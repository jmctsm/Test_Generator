electromagnetic spectrum
	range of wavelengths or frequencies over which electromagnetic radiation extends

laser
	light amplification through stimulated emissions of radiation
	
cornea
	the clear, dome-shaped tissues covering the front of the eye

eyebrow
	a patch of dense hairs located above the eye
	
eyelash
	one of the many hairs on the edge of the eyelids
	
eyelid
	the flap of skin that can cover and protect the eye
	
iris
	the colored part of the eye; it controls the amount of light that enters the eye by changing the size of the pupil
	
lens (eye)
	a crystalline structure located just behind the iris; it focuses light onto the retina
	
optic nerve
	the nerve that transmits electrical impulses from the retina to the brain
	
pupil	
	the opening in the center of the iris; it changes size as the amount of light changes; the more light, the smaller the hole
	
retina	
	sensory tissue that lines the back of the eye; it contains millions of photoreceptors (rods and cones) that convert light rays into electrical impulses that are relayed to the brain via the optic nerve

tear
	clear, salty liquid that is produced by glands in the eyes
	
vitreous
	a thick, transparent liquid that fills the center of the eye; it is mostly water and gives the eye its form and shape; also called the vitreous humor
	
hologram
	three-dimensional photograph that is produced using lasers
	
Common characteristic of all optical devices
	all produce or control light

refracting telescope
	uses lenses to gather and focus light from distant objects
	
reflecting telescope
	uses mirrors to gather and focus light from distant objects
	
microscope
	uses lenses to form a magnified image of very small, close objects

rods and cones
	cells in the retina
	
rod
	responds to low light
	
cone
	responds to wavelength of colors
	
lens
	transparent object with at least one curved side that causes light to change
	
concave
	thicker at the edges than in the middle
	
convex
	thicker in the middle than at the edge
